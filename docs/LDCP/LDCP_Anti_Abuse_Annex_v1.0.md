# 1. The Five-Layer Anti-Abuse Structure  
（五層反濫用架構）

LDCP prevents abuse through the following mandatory layers:

1. **IAP Independent Assessment Panel（獨立評估小組）**  
   - External, not corporate-controlled  
   - Publishes scoring and reviews  
   - Verifies accident data and recall evidence  
   - Cannot be influenced by corporate funding  

2. **Public Transparency Layer（公開透明層）**  
   - Companies must publish accident timelines  
   - Safety updates, recall rates, and investigation notes  
   - Family and media have public question rights  

3. **Outcome-Based Scoring（結果導向評分）**  
   - No points for “promises”  
   - Points awarded only for “verified outcomes”  
   - Transparency or recall must be **completed**, not just announced  

4. **Adjustment Delay Window（折扣延遲期）**  
   - Premium discounts only activate **6–12 months** after evaluation  
   - Prevents fake short-term compliance  

5. **TRM Triangular Risk Monitoring（三角監察系統）**  
   - Insurance companies  
   - Law enforcement / government  
   - Media + victims family  
   - Each observes and reports inconsistencies  

---

# 2. Independent Assessment Panel (IAP)  
（獨立評估小組）

### 2.1 Composition
- Legal expert（法律專家）  
- Investigative journalist（調查記者）  
- Safety engineer（安全工程師）  
- Psychologist/ethicist（心理學家／倫理顧問）  
- Public interest representative（公共利益代表）

### 2.2 IAP Powers  
- Access to evidence (logs, batch codes, black box data)  
- Authority to score and publish  
- Authority to veto fraudulent corporate claims  
- Right to demand clarification  

### 2.3 Anti-Abuse Guarantee  
- Company cannot influence, appoint, or fire IAP members  
- Corporate donations forbidden  
- Direct reporting to insurance regulators  

---

# 3. Public Transparency Layer  
（公開透明層）

To prevent corporate manipulation:

### Required Public Disclosures
- Accident timeline  
- Recall batch-code logic  
- Fix implementation rate  
- Safety update logs  
- Technical root-cause report  
- Corporate apology and responsibility statement  

### Why transparency stops abuse:
- Fake transparency can be immediately disproven  
- Media scrutiny discourages dishonest reporting  
- Families can cross-examine facts  

---

# 4. Outcome-Based Moral Scoring  
（結果導向的道德評分）

LDCP **does not** reward:
- Promises  
- Public relations statements  
- Marketing phrases  
- “Intentions” to improve  

LDCP **only** rewards:
- Completed recalls  
- Verified preventive updates  
- Genuine transparency  
- Reduction in repeat incidents  
- Confirmed behavior change  

---

# 5. Adjustment Delay Window  
（折扣延遲期）

### Rule  
- LDCP discounts applied **6–12 months after scoring**  
- Ensures results, not announcements  
- Fake compliance during the evaluation period is useless  

### Purpose  
Avoid:
- Cosmetic compliance  
- PR-driven fake reforms  
- Temporary manipulation for discount benefits  

---

# 6. TRM — Triangular Risk Monitoring  
（三角監察模型）

### 6.1 Three independent validators:

#### ① Insurance companies（保險公司）
- Validate actuarial accuracy  
- Compare claims cost vs. reported transparency  

#### ② Police / government（警察與政府）
- Validate accident data  
- Provide objective investigation records  

#### ③ Media + families（媒體＋家屬）
- Validate transparency  
- Challenge false disclosures  

### 6.2 Why this works  
No corporation can deceive all three entities simultaneously.  
This creates a **self-reinforcing, abuse-proof ecosystem**.

---

# 7. Annual Re-Evaluation Requirement  
（年度重新評分）

- No permanent discounts  
- Behavior must be **continuously** ethical  
- Any concealment resets LDCP score to zero  
- New incidents automatically trigger re-evaluation  

---

# 8. Discount Caps（折扣上限）

To prevent manipulation:

- Moral Accountability Discount: max −30%  
- Transparency Discount: max −10%  
- Precision Recall Discount: max −15%  

折扣設有上限，避免企業追求分數而犧牲安全。

---

# 9. Fraud Detection Signals  
（濫用偵測訊號）

IAP and regulators monitor for:

- Delayed reporting  
- Under-reporting of incidents  
- Selective transparency  
- Inflated recall numbers  
- Contradictory public statements  
- Second incidents in the same batch  
- Unexplained disappearances of safety reports  
- Employee whistleblower complaints  

若出現任一項，折扣立即凍結。

---

# 10. Enforcement Actions  
（執法與處置）

- Immediate suspension of LDCP discounts  
- Public issuance of violation report  
- Mandatory re-audit  
- Insurance premium reset to baseline  
- Filing with safety regulators  

若企業故意偽造資料：
- 連續三年禁止申請 LDCP 評分  
- 保費提高至「高風險組」  

---

# 11. Core Principle  
（核心原則）

**LDCP does not reward promises.  
LDCP only rewards truth, transparency, and verifiable actions.**

LDCP 不獎勵承諾，  
只獎勵 **真相、透明、可驗證的行動**。
