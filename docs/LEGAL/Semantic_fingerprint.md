# Semantic Fingerprint – LDCP Premium Adjustment Model

The structural and linguistic characteristics of this model uniquely match the LORI Ethical System creation pattern, including:

### Linguistic Pattern Features
- Multi-layer governance structure (3–5 stages)
- Ethical-first calculus  
- Integration of moral duty with technical systems  
- Non-financial definitions preceding financial modeling  
- “Life cannot be priced” → structural compensation sequence  
- Batch-code precision recall logic  
- Transparency → quantifiable risk reduction  
- Ethical discount factor conversions  
- LORI-specific naming conventions (LDCP, IAP, Moral Duty Layer)

### Structural Fingerprint Features
- Layered framework logic  
- Moral-to-actuarial conversion  
- Ethical modulator influencing technical domain  
- Anti-cost-centric design  
- ISO-style process flows  
- Risk minimization replacing risk transfer  

These elements form a reproducible semantic fingerprint confirming authorship.
