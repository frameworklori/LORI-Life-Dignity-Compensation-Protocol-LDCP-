# DISCLAIMER  
## Role & Responsibility Boundary Statement  
## LDPC (Life Dignity Compensation Protocol)

This document defines the scope, intent, and responsibility boundaries of the **LDPC (Life Dignity Compensation Protocol)** framework.

---

## 1. Purpose of LDPC

LDPC is a **conceptual and structural framework** for exploring *survivable transition mechanisms* during periods of large-scale technological disruption, including but not limited to AI-driven labor displacement.

Its purpose is to:
- identify systemic risk points,
- model institutional failure modes,
- and explore **design-constrained options** that reduce escalation, instability, and zero-sum outcomes.

LDPC is a study in **systemic stability and transition management**,  
not a moral claim, policy mandate, or compensation demand.

---

## 2. Intent Clarification

LDPC does **not** exist to:
- appease consumers,
- defend or criticize corporations,
- optimize shareholder sentiment,
- advocate redistribution,
- or assert ethical superiority for any stakeholder group.

Any benefit experienced by corporations (risk containment, predictability) or individuals (reduced transition harm) is a **byproduct of structural design**, not an expression of alignment, endorsement, or advocacy.

The sole intent is to examine whether **mutual survivability** is achievable during high-volatility technological transitions.

---

## 3. Role Definition

The author(s) and contributors to LDPC act solely as:

> **Framework designers and system modelers**

They do **not**:
- make policy decisions,
- allocate funds,
- define eligibility criteria,
- enforce rules,
- provide legal, financial, or regulatory advice,
- represent corporate, governmental, or public interests,
- or speak on behalf of any institution, regulator, company, or affected population.

LDPC provides **design boundaries and options**, not directives.

---

## 4. Responsibility Boundary (Critical)

All responsibilities associated with any adoption or implementation of concepts derived from LDPC rest entirely with the implementing parties.

Specifically:

- **Decision Authority**  
  Rests exclusively with governments, corporations, regulators, or institutions choosing to adopt, modify, or reject the framework.

- **Financial Responsibility**  
  Rests with entities that voluntarily commit funding or resources.

- **Operational Responsibility**  
  Rests with institutions that administer, execute, or enforce any resulting programs.

LDPC itself:
- assigns no legal liability,
- asserts no causal claims,
- and creates no obligations.

---

## 5. Non-Attribution & Professional Disclaimer

LDPC must not be cited, presented, or interpreted as:
- a corporate CSR proposal,
- an ESG advocacy document,
- a legal standard,
- a financial audit recommendation,
- or a declaration of moral fault, liability, or responsibility.

**LDPC does not provide legal, financial, accounting, or regulatory advice.**  
Any such interpretation constitutes a **misrepresentation of scope**.

---

## 6. Ethical Positioning & Neutralization Principle

LDPC treats ethics as an **emergent property of structural robustness**, not as a persuasive claim or moral directive.

A core design principle of LDPC is **Neutralization**:
> Highly conflict-prone social variables (e.g., dignity, responsibility, harm) are intentionally *neutralized* into system parameters to prevent escalation, polarization, or moral deadlock.

LDPC does not argue what institutions *should* do morally.  
It explores what institutions *can do without triggering greater systemic harm*.

---

## 7. Adoption Disclaimer

Use of LDPC concepts, models, formulas, terminology, or frameworks does not imply:
- endorsement by the author(s),
- shared responsibility for outcomes,
- or transfer of accountability.

Adoption is entirely voluntary and context-dependent.

---

## 8. Summary Statement

> LDPC does not choose sides.  
> It defines constraints.  
>  
> It does not demand action.  
> It outlines survivable options.  
>  
> Responsibility begins only where voluntary adoption occurs.
>

## Clarification on UBI-Stable

Any reference to "UBI-Stable" within the LDPC framework refers to a **non-redistributive financial stability mechanism**, not a universal income guarantee or social welfare claim.

UBI-Stable is defined strictly as:
- a low-level,
- fixed,
- non-means-tested liquidity floor,

designed to prevent systemic default cascades during transition shocks.

It does not constitute income replacement, employment entitlement, or social policy advocacy.
