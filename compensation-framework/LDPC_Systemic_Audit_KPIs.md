# LDPC Systemic Audit KPIs  
## Privacy-Preserving Performance Metrics

---

## 1. Audit Scope

Audits assess **institutional throughput and accessibility**, not moral merit.

---

## 2. Core KPIs

- **Access Delay (TTS):** Median time to entry  
- **Coverage Rate:** Availability to eligible population  
- **Completion Rate:** Pathway throughput  
- **Capacity Utilization:** Load vs design capacity  
- **Equity of Access:** Variance across demographic groups (aggregated)

---

## 3. Zone Classification

- Green: Within tolerance  
- Yellow: Degradation risk  
- Red: Structural failure

---

## 4. Data Minimization Principle

- Audit triggers rely on **metadata only** (latency, capacity, throughput).
- No individual-level behavioral or identity data is used.
- This minimizes GDPR, privacy, and surveillance risk for funding entities.

---

## 5. Audit Role

Audits exist to:
- protect participants from dead-end systems,
- protect funders from open-ended exposure,
- and prevent auditing itself from becoming a monitoring apparatus.

---

## 6.Additional Financial Stability Indicators

- **Debt Service Continuity Rate (DSCR-lite):**
  Percentage of participants maintaining minimum debt payments.

- **Early Delinquency Signal:**
  Aggregated increase in 30–60 day delinquency risk within high-transition-risk cohorts.

These indicators are evaluated only at aggregate level
and are used solely to assess systemic stress,
not individual creditworthiness.
