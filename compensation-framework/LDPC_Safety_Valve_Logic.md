# LDPC Safety Valve Logic  
## Automated Failure Containment

---

## 1. Purpose

The Safety Valve prevents institutional bottlenecks from converting conditional mechanisms into coercive traps.

---

## 2. Trigger Basis

Triggers are based on **system performance**, not individual behavior.

---

## 3. Escalation Tiers

### Tier 1 — Warning State
- Any KPI enters Yellow Zone
- Action:
  - Next-period Layer 1 budget reduced by 10%
  - Reallocated to Layer 0

### Tier 2 — Failure State
- KPI remains Red for two consecutive audit cycles
- Action:
  - Up to 40% of Layer 1 funds reallocated to Layer 0

---

## 4. Automation & Hysteresis Protection

- Reallocation decisions are **calculated at the end of each audit cycle**.
- Execution occurs **in the following fiscal period**.
- This delay prevents oscillation (“chattering”) and preserves accounting stability.

---

## 5. Design Rationale

> If transition channels fail to function, funds must migrate to higher-utility structures.

---

# 6.Priority Reallocation Rule

When Safety Valve conditions are triggered:

- Reallocated funds from Layer 1 **must first reinforce Layer 0 UBI-Stable capacity**
  before expanding other public investments.

This ensures that during institutional failure or pathway congestion,
liquidity stabilization precedes infrastructure expansion.
