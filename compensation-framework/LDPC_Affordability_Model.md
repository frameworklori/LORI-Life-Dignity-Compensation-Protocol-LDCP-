# LDPC Affordability Model  
## Transition Management Expense View

---

## 1. Purpose

This model translates LDPC into **bounded financial parameters** for executive and board-level evaluation.

It evaluates **exposure containment**, not moral obligation.

---

## 2. Core Parameters

- **R**: Annual Revenue  
- **P**: Annual Net Profit  
- **C_cap**: Annual Transition Management Expense Cap  
  - Suggested range: 1–3% of P  
- **D**: Program duration (years)  
- **W_risk**: Estimated size of high-transition-risk workforce

---

## 3. Cost Allocation Logic

- **Layer 0 (Fixed):**  
  `C_cap × α` (typically 30–40%)

- **Layer 1 (Variable):**  
  `min(C_cap × (1 − α), Interest_Relief_Requirement)`

---

## 4. Financial Impact Indicators

- **EPS Impact (post-tax):**

$$
\Delta EPS = \frac{C_{cap} \times (1 - tax)}{shares}
$$

- **Cash Flow Stability:**  
  Quarterly settlement + capped exposure

---

## 5. Hedge Analysis (Non-ROI)

By defining a predictable expenditure cap (C_cap), the framework functions as a **volatility hedge**:

- reduces litigation tail risk,
- stabilizes regulatory expectations,
- may lower equity risk premium,
- potentially improves WACC over long horizons.

---

## 6. Interpretation Rule

This model evaluates **affordability and downside containment**, not obligation.
