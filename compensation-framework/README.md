LDPC LORI - Life Dignity Compensation Protocol

Life Dignity Compensation Protocol (v2.0 - Integrated UBI Stable Version)

LDPC is a layered architecture designed to manage the friction between "rapid technological advancement" and "social stability." It combines "universal survival guarantees" with "structural pressure relief" to ensure technological progress does not come at the cost of individual dignity and social order.

🛠 Core Components & Layered Logic

This protocol employs a four-layer architecture aimed at establishing a buffer zone from "survival" to "transition":

1. Framework Design

Layer 0: Universal Survival Layer (Universal / UBI)

Core: Integrates UBI (Universal Basic Income)
Function: Provides unconditional material baseline for all citizens, ensuring basic survival is not threatened during waves of technological unemployment
Layer 1: High-Stress Compensation Layer

Core: Interest relief for high-debt unemployed individuals
Function: Provides structured interest subsidies for groups who become unemployed due to technological progress and carry high financial leverage (mortgages, debts). This serves as a "cooling mechanism" to prevent violent social unrest
Layer 2: Conditional Transition Layer

Core: Transition pathway incentives
Function: Provides advanced credit lines and resource connections for individuals entering certified transition pathways
Layer 3: Voluntary Ecosystem Layer

Core: Corporate ecosystem points and credit
2. Affordability Model

Funding Source: Financed by excess profits generated from technological progress (e.g., AI taxes, automation dividends)
Exposure Cap: Defines annual budget ceiling C_cap to ensure corporations operate within bearable financial pressure (Δ EPS impact formula)
Interest Adjustment: Automatically adjusts Layer 1 interest subsidy ratios dynamically based on unemployment rates and debt default risk indicators
3. Safety Valve Logic

Failure Containment: When Layer 1 (interest compensation) and Layer 2 (transition) systems operate inefficiently, causing increased social instability factors, funds automatically flow back to Layer 0 (UBI) to strengthen baseline defense
Anti-Violence Mechanism: Monitors social "financial stress index," prioritizing "interest decompression" for high-risk groups to eliminate structural motivations for violent resistance
Anti-Coercion: The system should not become a surveillance tool; participation in compensation mechanisms does not represent surrendering the right to choose one's own technological pathway
4. Systemic Audit KPIs

TTS (Time-to-Service): Measures the speed from unemployment occurrence to "interest compensation" delivery
Stress Relief Rate: Monitors financial stability of high-debt groups after receiving compensation
Privacy First: Audits based on decentralized or aggregated data to protect citizens from being scored by technocratic systems
🏗 Design Principles

Survival is a right, dignity is the baseline: UBI handles survival, LDCP handles dignity
Precision cooling: Identifying and compensating high-debt groups most likely to trigger violent social unrest is a necessary cost for maintaining continuous technological progress
Non-predatory development: Ensures tech companies do not profit during accelerated evolution by diluting the fruits of ordinary people's past labor (such as savings interest)
