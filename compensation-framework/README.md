LDPC: Life Dignity Compensation Protocol
A Structural Framework for Systemic Stability during Technological Transitions
🚩 IMPORTANT: DISCLAIMER & ROLE BOUNDARY
This repository contains a conceptual framework, not a policy mandate.
1. Nature of Framework: LDPC is a study in Institutional Reliability Engineering. It defines design options for survivable transition mechanisms during large-scale technological disruption (e.g., AI-driven labor shifts).
2. No Decision Authority: The author(s) do not make policy decisions, allocate funds, or define eligibility. All responsibility for adoption rests with the implementing corporations or governments.
3. Non-Advocacy: LDPC does not exist for consumer appeasement or moral advocacy. It is a risk-containment tool designed to minimize zero-sum escalation and systemic damage.
4. No Liability: Use of this framework does not assign legal guilt or causal responsibility to any party.

"LDPC does not choose sides. It defines constraints."
📖 Executive Summary
The Life Dignity Compensation Protocol (LDPC) provides a layered architecture to manage the friction between rapid technological advancement and societal stability. By decoupling funding from eligibility, and anchoring both in systemic performance, LDPC offers a path for institutions to navigate transitions without incurring open-ended liability or ethical erosion.
🛠 Core Components
The protocol is organized into four functional modules:
1. Framework Design
Defines the three-layer architecture:
• Layer 0 (Universal): Unconditional floor via public infrastructure.
• Layer 1 (Conditional): Structured interest relief for those in certified transition pathways.
• Layer 2 (Voluntary): Supplementary corporate tools and ecosystem credits.
2. Affordability Model
A parameterized financial view for CFOs and Boards:
• Exposure Capping: Defines the C_{cap} (Annual Budget Cap).
• Financial Indicators: Formulas for \Delta EPS impact and cash flow risk management.
• Risk Offset: Strategic analysis of litigation and regulatory de-escalation.
3. Systemic Audit KPIs
Neutral metrics to monitor institutional throughput:
• TTS (Time-to-Service): Measures system latency and bottlenecks.
• Coverage & Completion: Evaluates the actual functionality of transition pathways.
• Privacy-First: Audits rely on aggregated metadata, not individual behavioral scoring.
4. Safety Valve Logic
The automatic rebalancing mechanism:
• Failure Containment: Automatically reallocates funds from Layer 1 to Layer 0 if transition pathways fail to meet performance thresholds.
• Anti-Coercion: Ensures no system can demand participation if the system itself is non-functional.

🏗 Design Principle
"Dignity is unconditional. Participation only affects velocity, not worth."

LDPC treats ethical stability as an emergent outcome of structural robustness. It is designed to be structurally survivable for corporations while remaining ethically non-extractive for individuals.
