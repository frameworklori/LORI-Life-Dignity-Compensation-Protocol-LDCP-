# LDPC Layered Implementation Framework  
## Decoupled Design for Systemic Stability

---

## 1. Framework Objective

This document defines a **layered and decoupled structural design** for LDPC, intended to manage systemic risk during large-scale technological transitions.

The framework does **not** mandate adoption.  
It specifies **design constraints** under which transition mechanisms remain legally, financially, and institutionally survivable.

## 2. Layered Structure Overview

### Layer 0 — Universal Public Investment (Fixed)

**Nature:**  
Unconditional, non-extractive public infrastructure investment.

**Examples:**  
- Public education infrastructure  
- Libraries and digital access  
- Tuition reduction mechanisms  
- Open transition resources

**Design Purpose:**  
- Establish a dignity floor  
- Prevent exclusion or coercion  
- Absorb system-wide transition shock

---

### Layer 1 — Conditional Interest Relief (Variable)

**Nature:**  
Targeted financial volatility mitigation.

**Mechanism:**  
- Interest-only relief (not principal forgiveness)  
- Opt-in via institution-certified transition pathways

**Design Purpose:**  
- Reduce default cascades  
- Stabilize high-risk cohorts without asserting causality  
- Keep exposure capped and time-bounded

---

### Layer 2 — Voluntary Ecosystem Support (Optional)

**Nature:**  
Non-binding supplementary resources.

**Examples:**  
- Tools, certificates, platform credits

**Design Purpose:**  
- Accelerate recovery without creating dependency  
- Never serve as eligibility gates for Layer 0 or Layer 1

---

## 3. Core Design Principle

> Dignity is unconditional.  
> Participation affects velocity, not worth.

---

## 4. Decoupling & Institutional Neutrality

To ensure legal and political survivability, LDPC enforces strict decoupling:

- **Funding entities hold no discretionary power over individual eligibility.**
- **Operational gatekeeping is exclusively reserved for public or independent third-party institutions.**
- Funding, eligibility determination, and execution are structurally separated.

This separation prevents:
- corporate involvement in individual adjudication,
- liability expansion via personalized claims,
- and reputational exposure arising from case-level disputes.
