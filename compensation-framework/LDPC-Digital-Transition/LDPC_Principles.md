# LDPC Core Principles

## 1. Compensation ≠ Liability
LDPC explicitly distinguishes **ethical compensation** from legal or financial liability.

Compensation in LDPC means:
- Access to tools
- Access to knowledge
- Access to transition agency

It does **not** imply fault, obligation, or restitution.

---

## 2. Capability Over Outcome
LDPC does not guarantee employment or success.

Instead, it ensures that individuals are not structurally blocked from attempting transition due to:
- Information asymmetry
- Tool inaccessibility
- Artificial credential barriers

---

## 3. Voluntary Participation
All LDPC-aligned resources must be:
- Open-access
- Voluntary
- Non-coercive

No eligibility screening.
No exclusion mechanisms.

---

## 4. Dignity Preservation
LDPC rejects narratives that equate:
- Skill obsolescence with personal failure
- Economic displacement with lack of worth

Transition periods are treated as **civilizational phenomena**, not individual deficiencies.

---

## 5. Platform Safety Alignment
LDPC is intentionally designed to be compatible with:
- Open education platforms
- Corporate governance constraints
- Shareholder accountability boundaries

LDPC does not require platforms to:
- Admit causality
- Provide financial remedies
- Assume employment responsibility
