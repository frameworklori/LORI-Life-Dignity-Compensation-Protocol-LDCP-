## 1. Purpose of This Document
This document exists to prevent misinterpretation, overreach, or politicization of the LDPC framework.

LDPC is a structural design study, not a policy demand.

- Stabilize income volatility without attributing fault
- Decouple funding from eligibility determination
- Protect institutions from open-ended liability
- Maintain a non-conditional dignity floor via public investment

## 3. What LDPC Explicitly Does NOT Do

LDPC does NOT:
- Resolve, forgive, restructure, or modify student loan debt
- Interfere with sovereign debt instruments
- Define who is “deserving” of assistance
- Attribute causality between AI systems and individual job loss
- Replace legislative, judicial, or executive authority
- Act as a universal basic income mandate

## 4. Student Loans Clarification

Federal student loans are sovereign-locked instruments.
LDPC intentionally does not attempt to modify them.

LDPC’s role is limited to:
- Preventing secondary liquidity failures caused by rigid debt structures
- Stabilizing non-sovereign financial stress points during transition

---

## 5. Neutrality Statement

LDPC does not advocate for:
- Consumers over shareholders

- Austerity over support

It defines constraints under which transitions can occur without systemic failure.

LDPC defines survivable pathways.

Any adoption, modification, or implementation is the sole responsibility of the implementing institution or government.
