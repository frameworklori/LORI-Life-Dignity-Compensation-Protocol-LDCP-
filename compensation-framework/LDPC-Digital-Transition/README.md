# LDPC – Life Dignity Compensation Protocol  
### Digital Transition Edition

LDPC (Life Dignity Compensation Protocol) is a **conceptual framework** for navigating large-scale workforce disruption during periods of rapid technological transition, including AI-driven change.

This repository does **not** propose financial compensation, employment guarantees, or policy mandates.

Instead, LDPC focuses on a single principle:

> **Human dignity must be preserved during systemic transitions by ensuring access to viable transition tools, knowledge, and agency.**

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of LDPC is to:
- Reduce transition friction during technological disruption
- Prevent dignity erosion caused by sudden skill obsolescence
- Offer **capability-based transition pathways**, not promises

This repository documents:
- Core LDPC principles
- Platform-safe implementation logic
- Practical use cases for open education and skill enablement

## ⚠️ Important Notice

LDPC is:
- Not a legal framework
- Not a compensation policy
- Not an employment or retraining guarantee

LDPC **does not assign responsibility or causality** to any company, platform, or technology provider.

It defines **ethical design constraints**, not obligations.
