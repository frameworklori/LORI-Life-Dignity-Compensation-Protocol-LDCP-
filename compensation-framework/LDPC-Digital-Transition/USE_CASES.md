LDPC Use Cases (Non-exhaustive List)

Use Case 1: Open AI Skills Education (Open video platform resource-sharing model—as an AI skills training platform)
A platform that provides free educational content on AI tools, automation, or digital workflows could align with LDPC in the following ways:

Remove unnecessary access barriers
Provide clear learning paths
Avoid restricting users through exploitative certificate/credential requirements
Do not imply any employment outcomes
Use Case 2: Agent-oriented Workflows
Teach individuals how to:

Coordinate AI tools
Design agent (Agent) workflows
Apply AI to engineering and non-engineering roles
Use AI to create added value (at the application level)
The math/science skills, coding/building ability, certification assessments, etc. needed in the AI era
The introspection, critical thinking, responsibility/risk-taking, integration, decision-making abilities, etc. needed in the AI era
Job role introductions needed in the AI era (including descriptions of tasks and responsibilities)
This can reduce friction in transition, but does not redefine the job market.

Use Case 3: Psychological Stabilization
Content covering topics such as:

Identity shock after being replaced
Anxiety over skill devaluation
Uncertainty during the transition period
These are viewed as normal reactions to systemic change, rather than personal failure.

Use Case 4: Independent Transition Paths
LDPC supports:

Experimentation and exploration in freelancing
One-person operating models (solo business models)
Human–AI hybrid workflows
No institutional endorsement required.
