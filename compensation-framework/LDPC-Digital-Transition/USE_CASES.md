# LDPC Use Cases (Non-Exhaustive)

## Use Case 1: Open AI Skill Education
Platforms hosting free educational content on AI tools, automation, or digital workflows may align with LDPC by:

- Removing unnecessary access barriers
- Providing clear learning pathways
- Avoiding exploitative credential gating

No employment outcome is implied.

---

## Use Case 2: Agent-Oriented Workflows
Teaching individuals how to:
- Coordinate AI tools
- Design agent workflows
- Apply AI to non-engineering roles

This lowers transition friction without redefining job markets.

---

## Use Case 3: Psychological Stabilization
Content addressing:
- Identity shock after displacement
- Skill devaluation anxiety
- Transition-period uncertainty

These are treated as **normal responses to systemic change**, not personal failure.

---

## Use Case 4: Independent Transition Paths
LDPC supports:
- Freelance experimentation
- One-person operations
- Hybrid human–AI workflows

No institutional endorsement required.
