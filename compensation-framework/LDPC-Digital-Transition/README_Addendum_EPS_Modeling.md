# Why LDPC Uses After-Tax EPS Modeling

### 1. Design Intent
LDPC does not appeal to goodwill, ethics signaling, or public sentiment.
It is designed to operate within the actual decision calculus of boards, CFOs, and capital markets.

For this reason, LDPC impact is expressed in **after-tax EPS**, not absolute cost.

### 2. Why EPS Matters

Institutional decision-makers optimize for:
- Earnings stability
- Volatility containment
- Predictable downside exposure

They do not optimize for:
- Moral narratives
- Undefined future liabilities
- Open-ended social obligations

EPS modeling translates LDPC from abstract ethics into a financial variable that can be priced, compared, and accepted.

### 3. After-Tax Perspective

Using after-tax EPS reflects:
- Actual shareholder burden
- Tax-deductible nature of operating expenses
- Real economic cost, not headline spend

This prevents LDPC from being mischaracterized as:
- A hidden tax
- An unbounded moral claim
- A precedent-setting liability

### 4. Cost Containment vs Tail Risk

LDPC reframes the question from:

> “How much moral responsibility do we bear?”

to:

> “How much volatility are we willing to absorb?”

This reframing is what makes adoption structurally possible.

### 5. Key Clarification

LDPC does NOT:
- Monetize dignity
- Price human worth
- Replace social policy

It simply ensures that systemic transition costs do not manifest as uncontrolled financial or social collapse.

### 6. Summary Statement

Only ethics that can be absorbed by financial systems can survive institutional reality.
EPS modeling is not cynicism; it is survivability engineering.
