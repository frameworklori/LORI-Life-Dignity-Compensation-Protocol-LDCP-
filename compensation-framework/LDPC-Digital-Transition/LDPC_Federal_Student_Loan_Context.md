## Why Federal Student Loan Interest Is Not the Primary Shock-Absorption Tool

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This document clarifies the **institutional structure of U.S. federal student loans** and explains why **LDPC does not rely on federal student loan interest rates** as a primary mechanism for managing AI-era transition shocks.

The goal is not to evaluate student loan policy, but to prevent **category errors** when assessing LDPC’s design scope.

## 2. Ownership Structure of U.S. Student Loans

As of recent years, approximately **92–93% of outstanding U.S. student loan balances** are **federal student loans**.

- **Creditor:** U.S. federal government  
- **Administered by:** contracted loan servicers  
- **Balance sheet exposure:** sovereign (not private banks)

Private student loans constitute a **minority share (≈7–8%)** and are held by private financial institutions.

## 3. How Federal Student Loan Interest Rates Are Set

Federal student loan interest rates are:

- **Fixed-rate**, not floating  
- **Determined by statute**, not discretionary policy  
- **Reset annually only for new loans**

### Legal Formula Structure

Since 2013, interest rates are set according to a legislated formula:

> **Federal Student Loan Rate =  
> 10-Year U.S. Treasury Yield + Statutory Margin**

Margins differ by loan type (undergraduate, graduate, PLUS), but once set, **the rate is fixed for the life of the loan**.

Existing loans do **not** reprice when macroeconomic conditions change.

## 4. Implications for Crisis Response

Because federal student loan rates are:
- legally locked,
- backward-looking,
- and applicable only to new borrowing,

they are **structurally slow** and **non-responsive** as real-time shock absorbers.

As a result:
- Federal student loans do **not** transmit immediate stress to private bank balance sheets.
- Defaults primarily impact **government fiscal position**, not banking system solvency.

This makes federal student loan pricing an **ineffective tool for preventing private credit contagion** during rapid labor transitions.

## 5. Why LDPC Does Not Target Federal Student Loan Rates

LDPC is designed to address **systemic financial instability**, not to redesign sovereign education finance.

Accordingly:
- LDPC does **not** assume authority to modify legislated federal loan pricing.
- LDPC does **not** treat federal student loans as a primary source of banking risk.
- LDPC focuses on **private debt channels** where interest amplification and default cascades occur.

---

## 6. LDPC Design Focus: Where Risk Actually Propagates

LDPC targets:
- private student loans,
- mortgages,
- auto loans,
- consumer credit,
- and other market-based debt instruments.

These are:
- adjustable,
- bank-held,
- and capable of triggering non-performing loan (NPL) cascades.

In contrast, federal student loans are **sovereign liabilities** with built-in political and fiscal buffers.

---

## 7. Structural Conclusion

> Federal student loan interest rates are designed for **predictability**, not for **macroeconomic shock absorption**.

LDPC therefore operates **around**, not **through**, federal student loan pricing mechanisms.

This distinction allows LDPC to:
- respond faster than legislative tools,
- reduce private-sector default risk,
- and complement (rather than interfere with) existing federal student loan policy.

---

## 8. Summary Statement

> **Federal student loans are primarily a sovereign liability, not a banking one.**  
>  
> **LDPC addresses private debt dynamics because that is where systemic financial risk actually accumulates during AI-driven transitions.**
